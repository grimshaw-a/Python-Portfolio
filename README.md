# Python Portfolio: Forest Game
<p>I learned some basics of Python in an introduction to computer science class. Using that very limited knowledge of coding, I created this ode to old school text games while sick in bed at my in-laws over Thanksgiving weekend. Since then I've learned a lot more about code, but haven't felt it was worth my time to try and update this game. Please enjoy the game, if you're into this type of thing. But if you're here to assess my coding skills, please refer to one of my Java repositories, as that is a better indication of where I currently stand.</p>
<p>Have fun, and good luck!</p>
